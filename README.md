# Business Process Optimize

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>As a process owner, I want to see statistics of process, So that I can Optimize it. We need to build a web application, which consumes API available in Camunda to show the below statistics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many process instances have been executed in the last 30 days, and how has this number changed over time? (bar chart or line chart)</li>
  <li>Most and lease frequently executed task</li>
  <li>The average time is taken for a process instance to finish</li>
  <li>The average time spent on a specific task</li>
</ul>
